# Bryn Newell - Mondo Robot Skills Test

### Hi Ali, Kelly, and Mondo Robot team!
#### Below are the instructions for running the project locally.
#### The main branch is also deployed at [https://bnewell-robot-app.netlify.app/#/](https://bnewell-robot-app.netlify.app/#/)
You'll note there are a few `TO DO`s left in the code - I wanted to leave notes of where I'd like to continue taking and working on this application.
It was a lot of fun to create and I hope you enjoy reviewing it as much as I enjoyed creating it!

Thanks so much and talk soon.
